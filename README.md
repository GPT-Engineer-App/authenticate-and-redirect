# authenticate-and-redirect

Add a login flow that forces users to authenticate before being redirected to the home page (make sure you send the user to the page after successfully logging in).  Use the Supabase REST API (DO NOT use the @supabase/supabase-js package) and assume I have a supabase project with following properties: 
- Project URL: https://mnwefvnykbgyhbdzpleh.supabase.co
- ANON KEY: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6Im1ud2Vmdm55a2JneWhiZHpwbGVoIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3MTMyNzQ3MzQsImV4cCI6MjAyODg1MDczNH0.tnHysd1LqayzpQ1L-PImcvlkUmkNvocpMS7tS-hYZNg
Make sure that: 
- You give the user an option to logout once logged in. 
- You make sure that login is persisted even after refreshing the page
